Dold-Thom, Homology and Optimal Transport.

This repository contains a draft article describing our version of Dold-Thom theorem, and it's relations to optimal transportation, sweepouts, and homology.
The key idea is to interpret homology on a space X as the homotopy groups on a configuration space AG(X), which can be viewed and topologized as the space of electroneutral signed measures on X (i.e. the space of +/- particle clouds on X with the property that the net charge is zero). This interpretation leads to natural generalization of Dold-Thom theorem, giving a natural equivalence between long exact sequence in relative homology to long exact homotopy sequence. As application, we find optimal transports readily provide nontrivial sweepouts of a given source space X.

The paper is incomplete. We continue to develop the electrodynamic model for the homotopy groups on AG(X). Our main inspiration is current discharges of the Sun, after the papers by Per Carlqvist and Hannes Alfven available at:
